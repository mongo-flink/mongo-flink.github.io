## What is Mongo flink?

MongoFlink is a connector between MongoDB and Apache Flink. It acts as a Flink sink (and an experimental Flink source), and provides transaction mode(which ensures exactly-once semantics) for MongoDB 4.2 above, and non-transaction mode for MongoDB 3.0 above.

MongoFlink is in its early phase, and any use, feedback or contribution is welcome!

# Start to use
## Prerequisite

- Flink 1.12 above. MongoFlink is built on top of the new sink API added in FLIP-143 or Flink 1.12.0.
- MongoDB 3.0 above. The official MongoDB Java driver supports 3.0 above.
- JDK 1.8 above.

## Build
MongoFlink is not registered on Maven central yet, so users need to build the artifacts first.

Checkout the project, and use Maven to install the project locally.

```
$ mvn install
```

Then add the following dependency in your project's pom.xml.

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.mongoflink</groupId>
    <artifactId>mongo-flink</artifactId>
    <version>0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```

## Code

Use MongoSink in your Flink application.

```java
    StreamExecutionEnvironment env = StreamExecutionEnvironment.getExecutionEnvironment();

    // non-transactional sink with a flush strategy of 1000 documents or 10 seconds
    Properties properties = new Properties();
    properties.setProperty(MongoOptions.SINK_TRANSACTION_ENABLED, "false");
    properties.setProperty(MongoOptions.SINK_FLUSH_ON_CHECKPOINT, "false");
    properties.setProperty(MongoOptions.SINK_FLUSH_SIZE, String.valueOf(1_000L));
    properties.setProperty(MongoOptions.SINK_FLUSH_INTERVAL, String.valueOf(10_000L));

    env.addSource(...)
       .sinkTo(new MongoSink<>("mongodb://user:password@127.0.0.1:27017", "mydb", "mycollection",
                               new StringDocumentSerializer(), properties));

    env.execute();
```

# Configuration

MongoFlink can be configured using properties.

## MongoSink

| key | description | default value |
| --- | ----------- | ------------- |
| sink.transaction.enable | Whether use transactions in MongoSink (requires MongoDB 4.2+). | false |
| sink.flush.on-checkpoint | Whether flush the buffered documents on checkpoint barriers. | false |
| sink.flush.size | Max buffered documents before flush. Only valid when `sink.flush.on-checkpoint` is `false`. | 1000 |
| sink.flush.interval | Flush interval in milliseconds. Only valid when `sink.flush.on-checkpoint` is `false`. | 30000 |
